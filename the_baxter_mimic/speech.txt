Hi. I'm Baxter.
I very much enjoyed being on the CineGlobe jury.
I can tell you, that I, really enjoyed session six.
Or I should say you, enjoyed session six.
However, I found it very, difficult to make a decision.
I don't know how you humans do it. 
I guess, judging art just isn't, yet, for machines.
But I will let, Mohanty, explain to you how I was going to decide my favorite film.
Mohanty, would, you, like to come up here?
Everyone, Mohanty, Sharada, from the Artificial Intelligence, lab at the, Ecole, Polytechnique, Federale, de Lausanne.
